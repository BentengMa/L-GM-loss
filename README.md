# L-GM-loss
Implementation of our CVPR 2018 paper "Rethinking Feature Distribution for Loss Functions in Image Classification"

We implemented it in Caffe. I have a tensorflow implementation but it hasn't been tested yet.
I'm arranging the code to make it look neat and (hopefully) a bit more beautiful.

To appear soon.
