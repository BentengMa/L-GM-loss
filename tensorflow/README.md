This is the tensorflow demo for the LGM loss.  
While the caffe version is more complete, this version does not support updating of the feature variances.

# Requirements
Python 3.5  
Tensorflow 1.3
(Other versions may work, but I haven't tested them.)

# Data
We use CIFAR100 data in hdf5 format, which I have uploaded. (links are posted on the main page of this repository)
